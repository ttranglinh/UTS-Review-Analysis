# UTS-Review-Analysis
This is an analysis of UTS reviews from 2 main sources Google Reviews and Seek across the years from 2011 to 2024.

**Background and Overview**

For any organization, especially the universities, in order to constantly improve the environment, feedback and reviews from relevant stakeholders are highly valuable.  Students are the one who experience the education and services on a daily basis, thus, their comments will provide a better understanding in how unversities can do to support their studying journey and future career path. 

With the goal to keep track with latest reviews and generate insights for future development, I have decided to do an analysis of reviews, particularly in UTS, in which I track these comments overtime and analyse the sentiments through the most common phrases.  

**Data Overview**

These data are crawled from [Google Reviews](https://www.google.com/search?q=UTS&sca_esv=aa46f2d90d76e83e&sxsrf=ADLYWILRf7i7Lmu7fxl-Lwj6D6lH-7i6Aw%3A1730030350959&source=hp&ei=DiseZ6y9N8nQ2roP2Lb2gAQ&iflsig=AL9hbdgAAAAAZx45HiXzDrIGWH7akXbflXmH70JyTwHt&ved=0ahUKEwis_JCkwa6JAxVJqFYBHVibHUAQ4dUDCBg&uact=5&oq=UTS&gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6IgNVVFMyChAjGIAEGCcYigUyChAjGIAEGCcYigUyChAjGIAEGCcYigUyCBAuGIAEGLEDMg4QLhiABBixAxjHARivATILEAAYgAQYsQMYgwEyCBAAGIAEGLEDMgUQABiABDIIEAAYgAQYsQMyCBAAGIAEGLEDSIwLUABYwgJwAHgAkAEAmAHuAaABiAWqAQUwLjEuMrgBA8gBAPgBAZgCA6ACrgXCAgQQIxgnwgILEC4YgAQYsQMYgwHCAg4QABiABBixAxiDARiKBcICDhAuGIAEGLEDGNEDGMcBwgIFEC4YgASYAwCSBwMyLTOgB6wn&sclient=gws-wiz#lrd=0x6b12ae265bb4a143:0x16e224b2bd8fa957,1,,,,) section and [Seek](https://www.seek.com.au/learning/provider/university-of-technology-sydney/reviews).
