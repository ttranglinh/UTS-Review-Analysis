# UTS-Review-Analysis
This is an analysis of UTS reviews from 2 main sources Google Reviews and Seek across the years from 2011 to 2024.

**Background and Overview**

For any organization, especially the universities, in order to constantly improve the environment, feedback and reviews from relevant stakeholders are highly valuable.  Students are the one who experience the education and services on a daily basis, thus, their comments will provide a better understanding in how unversities can do to support their studying journey and future career path. 

With the goal to keep track with latest reviews and generate insights for future development, I have decided to do an analysis of reviews, particularly in UTS, in which I track these comments overtime and analyse the sentiments through the most common phrases.  

**Data Overview**

These data are crawled from [Google Reviews](https://www.google.com/search?q=UTS&sca_esv=aa46f2d90d76e83e&sxsrf=ADLYWILRf7i7Lmu7fxl-Lwj6D6lH-7i6Aw%3A1730030350959&source=hp&ei=DiseZ6y9N8nQ2roP2Lb2gAQ&iflsig=AL9hbdgAAAAAZx45HiXzDrIGWH7akXbflXmH70JyTwHt&ved=0ahUKEwis_JCkwa6JAxVJqFYBHVibHUAQ4dUDCBg&uact=5&oq=UTS&gs_lp=Egdnd3Mtd2l6IgNVVFMyChAjGIAEGCcYigUyChAjGIAEGCcYigUyChAjGIAEGCcYigUyCBAuGIAEGLEDMg4QLhiABBixAxjHARivATILEAAYgAQYsQMYgwEyCBAAGIAEGLEDMgUQABiABDIIEAAYgAQYsQMyCBAAGIAEGLEDSIwLUABYwgJwAHgAkAEAmAHuAaABiAWqAQUwLjEuMrgBA8gBAPgBAZgCA6ACrgXCAgQQIxgnwgILEC4YgAQYsQMYgwHCAg4QABiABBixAxiDARiKBcICDhAuGIAEGLEDGNEDGMcBwgIFEC4YgASYAwCSBwMyLTOgB6wn&sclient=gws-wiz#lrd=0x6b12ae265bb4a143:0x16e224b2bd8fa957,1,,,,) section and [Seek](https://www.seek.com.au/learning/provider/university-of-technology-sydney/reviews). There are in total 925 reviews from 2011 and 2024. Only reviews with comments are analysed, those with only ratings are excluded from this dataset.

There are reviews mostly in 2018 on Seek, and negligible fluctuation in the number of reviews over the year on Google. However, the sentiment analysis will focus mostly on the comments and not the time period to have a general view.

With the constant flow of feedback from surveys across the university environment, this sentiment analysis model indicates how we can develop and keep track of feedback patterns overtime and generate insights for the proper actions.
